# Prompting guide 101

## A quick-start handbook for effective prompts

# Writing effective prompts

From the very beginning, Google Workspace was built to allow you to collaborate in real time with other people. Now, you can also collaborate with AI using Gemini for Google Workspace to help boost your productivity and creativity without sacrificing privacy or security. The embedded generative AI-powered features can help you write, organize information, create images, accelerate workflows, have richer meetings, and much more, all while using your favorite apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Meet, Google Slides, and Gemini Advanced (the standalone chat experience available at gemini.google.com with enterprise-grade security). Gemini is accessible right where you are doing your work — with access to your personal knowledge base in Drive, Docs, Gmail, and more — so you can enhance and create powerful workflows across the Workspace apps with less tab switching and interruption.

This guide provides you with the foundational skills to write effective prompts when using Gemini for Workspace. You can think of a prompt as a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. You might write several prompts as the conversation progresses. While the possibilities are virtually endless, you can put consistent best practices to work today.

The four main areas to consider when writing an effective prompt are:
* Persona
* Task
* Context
* Format

Here is an example of a prompt using all four areas that could work well in Gmail and Google Docs:

> You are a program manager in [industry]. Draft an executive summary email to [persona] based on [details about relevant program docs]. Limit to bullet points.

You don’t need to use all four in every prompt, but using a few will help! Always remember to include a verb or command as part of your task; this is the most important component of a prompt.

# Here are quick tips to get you started with Gemini for Google Workspace:

1. **Use natural language.** Write as if you’re speaking to another person. Express complete thoughts in full sentences.
2. **Be specific and iterate.** Tell Gemini what you need it to do (summarize, write, change the tone, create). Provide as much context as possible.
3. **Be concise and avoid complexity.** State your request in brief — but specific — language. Avoid jargon.
4. **Make it a conversation.** Fine-tune your prompts if the results don’t meet your expectations or if you believe there’s room for improvement. Use follow-up prompts and an iterative process of review and refinement to yield better results.
5. **Use your documents.** Personalize Gemini’s output with information from your own files in Google Drive.
6. **Make Gemini your prompt editor.** When using Gemini Advanced, start your prompts with: “Make this a power prompt: [original prompt text here].” Gemini will make suggestions on how to improve your prompt. Ensure it says what you need, and then paste it back into Gemini Advanced to get an output.

> Prompting is a skill we can all learn. You don’t have to be a prompt engineer to use generative AI. However, you will likely need to try a few different approaches for your prompt if you don’t get your desired outcome the first time. Based on what we’ve learned from our users so far, the most fruitful prompts average around 21 words with relevant context, yet the prompts people try are usually less than nine words.
>
> Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it’s still new. Even though our models are getting better every day, prompts can sometimes have unpredictable responses.
>
> Before putting an output from Gemini for Workspace into action, review it to ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the most important thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans but the final output is yours.
>
> The example prompts in this guide are meant for illustrative purposes.

# Introduction

## Gemini for Google Workspace: Prompting 101

Gemini for Workspace is your AI-powered assistant integrated into the apps you use every day — Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Meet, Google Slides, and Gemini Advanced (the standalone chat experience available at gemini.google.com with enterprise-grade security). This means the apps you know and use will work together smoothly so you can collaborate with Gemini right where you are. You can have fewer interruptions to your focus and workflow, helping you complete tasks and do things you might not have initially known how to do.

You can access the features of Gemini for Workspace in multiple ways. Engaging with Gemini in the side panel of your Workspace apps allows you to create highly personalized generative AI outputs that are based on your own files and documents — even if they aren’t Google Docs. You can generate personalized emails in seconds referencing your own Docs to pull in relevant context, generate Slides that are based on information directly from your own briefs or reports, and so much more.

Understanding what makes an effective prompt and learning to craft prompts on the fly can boost your productivity and creativity. Gemini for Workspace can help you:

* Improve your writing
* Organize data
* Create original images
* Summarize information and surface insights
* Have better meetings with automatic note taking
* Research unfamiliar topics easily
* Spot trends, synthesize information, and identify business opportunities

For 25 years, Google has built helpful, secure products that give users choice and control over their data. It’s a bedrock principle for us. This was the case back when we first launched Gmail in 2004, and it remains true in the era of generative AI. This means your data is your data and does not belong to Google. Your data stays in your Workspace environment. Your privacy is protected. Your content is never used for targeting ads or to train or improve Gemini or any other generative AI models.

# How to use this prompt guide

This guide introduces you to prompting with Gemini for Workspace. It includes strong prompt design examples to help you get started. Additionally, it covers scenarios for different personas, use cases, and potential prompts.

You will notice a variety of prompt styles. Some prompts have brackets, which indicate where you would fill in specific details or tag your own personal files by typing @file name. Other prompts are presented without variables highlighted to show you what a full prompt could look like. All of the prompts in this guide are meant to inspire you, but ultimately they will need to be customized to help you with your specific work.

To get started, use the role-specific suggested prompts as inspiration to help you unlock a new and powerful way of working.

**NEW** Use case: Manage multiple email inboxes

After returning from vacation, you have many unread, unsorted emails. You prompt Gemini in the Gmail side panel. You type:

> Summarize emails from [manager] from the last week. (Gemini in Gmail)

Gemini returns short summaries of each message. To directly access a message, you click on **Sources** and see tiles that bring you to specific emails. You select the most important one. Once the email thread opens, you see that many messages were exchanged. You prompt Gemini in Gmail:

Suggest different options for breakfast and dinner within a 10-minute walk of the hotel, and find one entertainment option such as a movie theater, a local art show, or a popular tourist attraction. Put it in a table for me. (Gemini Advanced) [Gemini icon]

You continue your conversation until you are happy with the itinerary. Before you make reservations, you want to share the draft with your manager. You select **Share & export** and select **Draft in Gmail**. Once the drafted email is created, you put the final touches on the message and send.

## **NEW** Use case: Track travel and entertainment budget

You want to create a spreadsheet to keep track of all of the travel expenses incurred. You open a new Google Sheet and prompt Gemini in the Sheets side panel. You type:

# Example use cases

## Analyst and public relations
### **NEW** Use case: Prepare for analyst or press briefings

You need to create a brief to prepare a spokesperson for an upcoming meeting with analysts and the media for a new product launch. You open a new Doc and prompt Gemini in the Docs side panel. You type:

> Generate a brief template to prepare [spokesperson] for an upcoming media and analyst briefing for @[Product Launch]. Include space for a synopsis, key messages, and supporting data. (Gemini in Docs)

This gives you a starting point to pull in additional information from your files. You prompt Gemini in the Docs side panel and tag your relevant files by typing @file name. You type:

> Craft a synopsis of the product launch in three main points using @[Product Launch - Notes]. (Gemini in Docs)

You click **Insert** before repeating the process to fill out the rest of the briefing document. Next, you need to create a spreadsheet of media and analyst contacts. You open a new Google Sheet and prompt Gemini in the Sheets side panel. You type:

> Organize my media and analyst contacts from @[Analyst and Journalist Contact Notes] for a new product briefing. I need to keep track of their names, type of contact (analyst or journalist), focus area, the name of the outlet, agency or firm that they work for, and a place where I can indicate the priority level of their attendance at this briefing (low, medium, high). (Gemini in Sheets)

Gemini in Sheets returns a spreadsheet, and you can go through and indicate priority level for each contact. Next, you want to create a slideshow to use during the briefing. You open a new Google Slide and prompt Gemini in the Slides side panel. You tag relevant files by typing @file name in the prompt. You type:

> Create a slide describing what [product] is from @[Product Launch - Notes]. Make sure it is short and easily understood by a broad audience. (Gemini in Slides)

Gemini returns a Slide. You continue to build your presentation by using this method to generate additional Slides.

# **NEW** Use case: Create mock interview questions to prepare spokespeople

Now, you need to prepare your company’s spokesperson for interviews that will follow the briefing. To generate a list of mock interview questions, you decide to chat with Gemini Advanced. You type:

> I am a [PR/AR] manager at [company name]. We just launched [product] and had a briefing where we discussed [key messages]. I am preparing [spokesperson and role/title] for interviews. Generate a list of mock interview questions to help [spokesperson] prepare. Include a mixture of easy and hard questions, with some asking about the basics of [product] and some asking about the long-term vision of [product]. (Gemini Advanced) ✦

Gemini returns a list of questions that can help you prepare your company’s spokesperson. You refine the suggested questions by continuing the conversation with Gemini. Then you select **Share & export** and **Export to Docs**. You open the newly created Doc, prompt Gemini in the Docs side panel, and tag relevant files by typing @file name. You type:

> Use @[Product Launch Notes] to write suggested answers for these questions. Write the talking points as if you are [title of spokesperson] at [company]. (Gemini in Docs) 📄

Gemini in Docs returns suggested talking points, and you select **Insert** to add them into your draft. Now you’re ready to continue tweaking the interview prep for your spokesperson.

## **Communications manager**
# **NEW** Use case: Craft internal communications

Your company has redesigned its intranet to be more user friendly. You’re in charge of internal communications for the launch. You want help drafting this message. You open a new Google Doc and prompt Gemini in the Docs side panel. You type:

> I need to draft a company-wide memo unveiling our relaunched intranet. The [new page] addresses [common feedback we heard from employees] and aims to create a more user friendly experience. Draft an upbeat memo announcing [the new site] using @[Intranet Launch Plan Notes]. (Gemini in Docs) 📄

At the bottom, it states: "Gemini for Workspace may display inaccurate information, including about people, so double-check its responses. Learn more".
*   A screenshot of the Gemini side panel showing a completed prompt and its response:
    *   **Prompt:** Use [Google Docs icon] Brainstorm Notes and Ideas 9/1/24 to write a meeting recap to the team using an upbeat and friendly tone. Share some of the ideas I have for our next meeting to discuss current popular literature.
    *   **Response:**

        I wanted to share a quick recap of our recent brainstorm on current popular literature and some ideas for our next discussion.
        
        We had a great conversation about the books that are currently resonating with readers, and I was particularly interested in our discussion of emerging trends and subgenres. I'd love to delve deeper into this topic in our next meeting.
        
        Here are some additional areas I think would be valuable to explore:
        *   **Genre & Theme Deep Dive:** Beyond specific titles, what broader genres and themes are capturing readers' attention? Are there any underlying cultural or societal factors influencing these trends?
        *   **Author & Publisher Landscape:** Who are the key players shaping the current literary scene? Are there any new voices or independent publishers we should be aware of? How are traditional publishing models adapting to the digital age?
        *   **Reader Engagement & Community:** How are readers interacting with and discussing popular literature? What role do online

> I need to make a vendor decision for packaging manufacturing. Create a table that compares the two proposals I’ve received @[Company A’s Proposal] and @[Company B’s Proposal]. (Gemini in Docs) 📄

Gemini creates a table comparing the two different proposals. You make a decision, but now you want to see if you can negotiate with your preferred vendor. You go to your inbox and start a new email draft. You prompt Gemini in the Gmail side panel. You type:

> Create an email draft to [selected vendor] telling them that I’ve decided to move forward with them as the [packaging] vendor, but I would like to negotiate [a bulk pricing discount]. Use a collaborative tone. (Gemini in Gmail) ✉️

Gemini in Gmail returns a drafted message that is ready to send. You select **Insert** and send the email.

## Use case: Plan and track budgets

You’re in planning mode and you first want to understand where previous years’ budgets were spent. You have all of this data in a Sheet. You decide to chat with Gemini Advanced. You upload the Sheet and prompt Gemini by typing:

> Using the attached spreadsheet, identify trends and patterns in our expenses by category over the last three years. Identify areas where costs have increased significantly and investigate potential reasons. (Gemini Advanced) ✦

Gemini returns a response that helps inform your budget proposal for next year.

# Head of Product
## Use case: Develop a product launch plan

Your team is creating a new product, and you want to conduct research to inform your launch plan in collaboration with the marketing team. Using Gemini, you want to simulate different launch scenarios based on factors like pricing, marketing strategies, and target audience. You go to Gemini Advanced to conduct research and type:

> I am head of product at [startup] in [industry] industry. We are building a product launch plan for [product]. I want to brainstorm a few different scenarios. We are considering offering the [product] at two different price points [A and B] and we are considering launching in [December or January]. Provide pros and cons of each scenario and suggest different ideas we may not have considered. (Gemini Advanced) ✦

You want to continue market research brainstorming. You type:

> How do these prices compare to [competitor products’] prices? Detail what pricing strategies [competitors] use for [products], and list any common tactics they use (such as free trials, discounts, etc.). Summarize how they position the product to [audience]. Cite your sources. (Gemini Advanced) ✦

Your research helps you refine your pricing structure and go-to-market strategy for your most important target audience.

## Use case: Develop product strategy and roadmap

You want to refine your product strategy and roadmap. You’ve collected user feedback in a spreadsheet, and you want to clean it up so that it is ready for deeper analysis. You chat with Gemini Advanced and upload a file. You type:

> Help me clean my [user feedback] survey spreadsheet. Specifically, fill any blank values in the name column with “Anonymous,” then if the [recommend] column shows [Yes], replace that with [Y]. Finally, remove any rows where the satisfaction column is blank. Please generate a new file for me with my cleaned data. (Gemini Advanced) ✦

Gemini returns a clean file for you to conduct deeper analysis on, and from this file, you notice a few trends. You have alignment from the team on features to address recurring user feedback, and now you want to build a high-level roadmap that you can use as a starting point. You continue your conversation with Gemini Advanced. You type:

> I am head of product at [startup] in the [industry] industry. We are adding [features] to our [product] to address recurring user feedback, including [feedback trends]. Build a high-level roadmap that will keep us on track for a Q4 delivery. Put it in a table format. (Gemini Advanced) ✦

Gemini returns a helpful starting point. You want to save the work so you click **Export to Docs.**

# Leveling up your prompt writing

This guide is meant to serve as inspiration, and the possibilities are nearly endless with Gemini for Google Workspace. Build on your prompt-writing skills using these tips.

* **Break it up.** If you want Gemini for Workspace to perform several related tasks, break them into separate prompts.
* **Give constraints.** To generate specific results, include details in your prompt such as character count limits or the number of options you’d like to generate.
* **Assign a role.** To encourage creativity, assign a role. You can do this by starting your prompt with language like: “You are the head of a creative department for a leading advertising agency …”
* **Ask for feedback.** In your conversation with Gemini Advanced, tell it that you’re giving it a project, include all the relevant details, and then describe the output you want. Continue the conversation by asking questions like, “What questions do you have for me that would help you provide the best output?”
* **Consider tone.** Tailor your prompts to suit your intended audience. Ask for outputs to have a specific tone, such as formal, informal, technical, creative, or casual.
* **Say it another way.** Fine-tune your prompts if the results don’t meet your expectations or if you believe there’s room for improvement. An iterative process of review and refinement often yields better results.

> Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it’s still new. Even though our models are getting better every day, prompts can sometimes have unpredictable responses.
